# **get_next_line**
Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious

## **Project overview**
The **get_next_line** project is an essential part of the **42 curriculum**.
It tasks students with creating a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, which will be a fundamental utility in many future projects.
This project aims to improve understanding of file I/O operations, buffer management, and dynamic memory allocation in C.

#### **Objective**
- **Read from File Descriptors**: Implement a function that reads a single line from a given file descriptor, handling multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- **Efficient Buffer Management**: Learn to manage buffers efficiently to ensure optimal performance and memory usage.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Enhance skills in using `malloc`, `free`, and other dynamic memory management functions to handle variable-length input.
- **Code Quality and Optimization**: Emphasis is placed on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

#### **Key features**
- **Line Reading Function**: Implementation of the `get_next_line` function to read one line at a time from a file descriptor.
- **Buffer Management**: Efficient use of buffers to handle input and minimize read operations.
- **Multiple File Descriptors Support**: Ability to handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously, maintaining separate buffers for each.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage edge cases and invalid inputs.

#### **Example Usage**
```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    line = get_next_line(fd);
    while (line != NULL)
    {
        printf("%s\n", line);
        free(line);
        line = get_next_line(fd);
    }
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```
